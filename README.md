# Hibernate ORM Assignment

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for the Hibernate ORM assignment. The assignment is divided into two parts:

## Part 1: CRUD Operations on a Single Entity

In this part, we focus on the `Book` entity and its attributes. The tasks include:

1. Setting up a Java project and configuring Hibernate with a suitable database (e.g., MySQL, H2).
2. Creating the necessary Java classes representing the `Book` entity with appropriate annotations for mapping.
3. Implementing CRUD operations for the `Book` entity, including create, retrieve, update, and delete.
4. Testing the CRUD operations using a simple console-based application.

## Part 2: Relationships between Entities (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)

In this part, we work with two entities, `Book` and `Author`, and establish various relationships between them using Hibernate annotations. The tasks include:

1. Creating the necessary Java classes representing the `Book` and `Author` entities with appropriate annotations for mapping.
2. Implementing one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between the entities.
3. Associating authors with their books using the defined relationships.
4. Testing the relationships to ensure they are correctly maintained.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Set up the database connection in the Hibernate configuration files (e.g., `hibernate.cfg.xml`).
4. Run the main classes for CRUD-opperations,manyToManyRelationship,oneToManyRelationship and oneToOneRelationship to test the CRUD operations and entity relationships.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the application to learn more about Hibernate ORM and entity relationships. Happy coding!
